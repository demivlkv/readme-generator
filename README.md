## Description
A quality README.md is essential for an important project. The README introduces the application, describes what the application is, how to use it, how to install, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

This particular project is a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md file with ease. To view a sample of a README.md file created with this application, please refer to the [README.md](/../main/dist/README.md) file in the `dist` folder.

## Installation
To install this application, `git clone` this repository, or download the `.zip` file in the dropdown after clicking the ‘Code’ button at the top of this repository—as long as it is in your local branch.

Using the code editor of your choice, ensure that **node.js** is installed (visit this [link here](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs) for info on how to install **node.js**). Then you would need to install **Inquirer.js** node package by entering `npm inquirer` in the command line of terminal. Documentation for **Inquirer** can be accessed [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

## Usage
It is important to note that you are in the root directory in order for this application to run successfully. This application will initialize by running this command line in terminal:
```
node index.js
```
The **Inquirer** package for Node.js triggers a series of questions regarding your project within the command line. Answer as many questions possible in order to show off a quality README presentation that includes a fancy table of contents.

The newly-generated README.md file will be found in the `dist` folder. Copy the contents and paste it to where you need it!
